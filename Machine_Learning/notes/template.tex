	\section{Introduction}
	From ancient times up to 2005, humans have created 130 exabytes of data. \\
	
	A definition of Machine Learning would be: The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuel. \\
	
	Types of machine learning:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Supervised learning (Regression \& Classification)
		\item Unsupervised learning (Clustering \& Association)
		\item Reinforced learning
	\end{itemize} 

Reinforced learning is feedback based, the agent gets rewards for every right action and get penalized for every wrong action.  \textbf{The agent interacts with its environment.} \\

\section{Machine learning Life cycle}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Data pre-processing \\
		- Import the data \\
		- Clean the data \\
		- Split the data into test and training parts

		\item Modeling \\
		- Build the model \\
		- Train the model \\
		- Make predictions

		\item Evaluation \\
		- Calculate performance metrics \\
		- Make a verdict
	\end{itemize}
